                    <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real
                        estate
                        developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters.
                        Currently,
                        the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two
                        Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many
                        residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>
                        <br>
    
                    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe
                        Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a
                        bridge
                        over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed
                        development projects and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and
                        diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>
                        <br>
    
                    <h3>"THE LEAGUE EMBRACES RESPONSIBLE AND DIVERSIFIED USE OF THE LAKE'S RESOURCES WHILE PROTECTING AND
                        RESTORING ITS NATURAL ATTRIBUTES"</h3>
    
                    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge
                        and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin,
                        California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality
                        information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the
                        basin.
                        The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in
                        the
                        Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality,
                        is
                        being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by
                        the
                        Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>
                        <br>
    
                    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is
                        dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific
                        information
                        for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a
                        well-publicized
                        "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>
